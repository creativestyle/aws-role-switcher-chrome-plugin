# Switch AWS roles easily

Overrides the default role history widget in AWS Console allowing you to have an unlimited number of roles to choose from. The roles are loaded from a remote JSON file of your choosing giving you flexibility and allowing to share the role collection with anybody.

It's not listed in Chrome Web Store currently so install by loading the 
`src/` dir as *unpacked extension* in developer mode.

Works OOTB in FireFox without modifications too.
